            <p><strong>Wellness App Notice:</strong> This app is intended for general wellness purposes only and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Always consult with healthcare professionals before making health-related decisions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="intro-text">Welcome to Amicado! These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Amicado, Inc. ("Amicado," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), a Delaware corporation, governing your use of our mobile application, website, and all related services (collectively, the "Services"). Amicado is an activity tracking and challenges platform that helps users build healthy habits, track their activities, participate in challenges, and receive AI-powered insights to optimize their wellness journey. By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
        
        <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.</strong> This agreement contains important information regarding your legal rights, including a mandatory arbitration provision and a class action waiver, which require you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Amicado on an individual basis and not as part of any class or representative action. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Contractual Framework</h2>
        
        <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding contract between you and Amicado. By clicking "I Accept," downloading our app, creating an account, or otherwise accessing or using the Services, you affirmatively accept these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately discontinue all use of the Services. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Services ("Users").</p>
        
        <p>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms. In that case, the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms, you must not accept these Terms and may not use the Services.</p>
        
        <p>For questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact us at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email: legal@amicado.com</li>
            <li>Mail: Amicado, Inc., Legal Department, 123 Wellness Way, San Francisco, CA 94105</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>User Eligibility Requirements</h2>
        
        <p>To use the Services, you must meet all of the following eligibility requirements:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Age Requirement (Updated for 2025 COPPA Changes):</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services. The Services are not intended for children under 18. This aligns with updated COPPA requirements effective June 23, 2025, which strengthen protections for minors. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18. For users between 13-17, parental consent would be required, and all data processing occurs strictly on-device with no server transmission. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without proper consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us personal information, please contact us immediately at privacy@amicado.com.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Legal Competency:</strong> You must be legally competent to enter into a binding contract. You may not use the Services if you are not legally competent to form a binding contract with Amicado, including if you are subject to any legal guardianship or conservatorship that would prevent such capacity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> You must use the Services in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>No Prior Suspensions:</strong> You must not have been previously suspended, terminated, or banned from using the Services. If your account has been terminated for violations of these Terms, you are prohibited from creating a new account or accessing the Services through any means.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Personal Use Only:</strong> The Services are for your personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the Services on behalf of any third party or for any commercial purpose without our express written consent. Commercial use includes, but is not limited to, reselling Services access, using the Services for business fitness programs without proper licensing, or integrating the Services into commercial wellness offerings.</p>
        
        <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>
        
        <p>We are constantly working to improve our Services and develop new features to provide you with the best possible experience. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our Services and practices. We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion.</p>
        
        <p>When we make changes to these Terms, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and post the updated Terms on the Services. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will provide you with notice of such changes through the Services interface, by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, or by push notification through the app. We will also provide you with at least thirty (30) days' notice before the updated Terms become effective, unless the changes are required by law, in which case they will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>
        
        <p>Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed about our practices. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your account. Your sole remedy if you do not agree with any changes to these Terms is to discontinue your use of the Services.</p>
        
        <p>For your convenience, we maintain a version history of these Terms, which you can access by contacting our support team at support@amicado.com. This allows you to review what has changed between versions and understand how the Terms have evolved over time.</p>
        
        <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>
        
        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information when you use our Services. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of these Terms by reference. By using the Services, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in our Privacy Policy, which is available at www.amicado.com/privacy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Children's Privacy:</strong> The Services are not directed to children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you are under 18, you may not use the Services or provide any personal information to us. For users between 13 and 18 years of age who may attempt to use the Services despite our age restrictions, we want you and your parents to know that any data from such users remains strictly on-device and is never transmitted to our servers. This includes all activity data, mood tracking, challenge participation, and any health-related information. The only exception would be if a parent or guardian explicitly creates and manages an account on behalf of a minor, in which case the parent or guardian assumes full responsibility for the account and its data.</p>
        
        <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at privacy@amicado.com. Upon verification, we will promptly delete such information from our servers. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to help enforce our Terms by instructing their children never to provide personal information through the Services.</p>
        
        <p><strong>HealthKit and Health Data - Absolute Privacy Protection:</strong> Amicado integrates with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit to provide you with comprehensive activity tracking. Importantly, all HealthKit and Google Fit data is processed entirely on your device and is never collected or transmitted to our servers. This on-device processing ensures your sensitive health data remains private and secure. We commit to absolute restrictions regarding HealthKit data:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Prohibition on Marketing Use:</strong> We will never use HealthKit data for advertising, marketing, or promotional purposes</li>
            <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing for Marketing:</strong> We cannot and will not share HealthKit data with third parties for any marketing purpose, as we don't have access to it</li>
            <li><strong>Local AI Processing Only:</strong> All AI-powered insights are generated on-device using advanced machine learning models that run locally on your phone, ensuring your health data never leaves your device</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We can read data from HealthKit and Google Fit (with your permission) to enhance your activity tracking experience, but this data never leaves your device or reaches our servers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What are the most important things to remember when using Amicado?</h2>
        
        <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>WELLNESS APP - NOT MEDICAL ADVICE</strong></p>
            <p>The Services are intended for general wellness and motivational purposes only. As a wellness app, Amicado provides activity tracking, challenges, and on-device insights to help you stay motivated and track your progress. Nothing contained in the Services should be construed as medical advice. The Services are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The information provided through the Services is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>No Professional Relationship:</strong> Your use of the Services does not create a doctor-patient relationship or any other professional healthcare relationship between you and Amicado. We are not a licensed medical provider, and nothing contained in the Services should be construed as medical advice. Our Services provide wellness tracking and motivational tools only.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Consult Healthcare Professionals:</strong> You should always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding your health, fitness routine, diet, or any medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read, seen, or experienced through the Services. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor, go to the emergency department, or call emergency services immediately.</p>
        
        <h3>General Health Considerations</h3>
        
        <p>As with any wellness app, you should consult with your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise program or making significant lifestyle changes, especially if you have any medical conditions or are taking medications.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Always pay attention to how you feel during activities and stop immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, or extreme fatigue.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Special Populations:</strong> If you are pregnant, nursing, have chronic medical conditions, or are taking medications, please consult with your healthcare provider before using our wellness tracking features.</p>
        
        <h3>Wellness Activity Participation</h3>
        
        <p>Participation in physical activities and wellness challenges through our app is voluntary and at your own risk. Always exercise within your comfort zone and stop any activity if you feel uncomfortable or experience any concerning symptoms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mood Tracking:</strong> Our mood tracking features are designed for general wellness awareness only and are not a substitute for professional mental health treatment. If you're experiencing mental health concerns, please consult with a qualified mental health professional.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Crisis Resources:</strong> If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact 988 (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) or 911 for immediate help. Amicado is a wellness app and is not equipped to provide crisis support.</p>
        
        <h3>Additional Important Considerations</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong> While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we make no representations or warranties about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any information provided through the Services. Scientific understanding of health, fitness, and wellness evolves continuously, and information that was accurate when posted may become outdated. Always verify information with qualified professionals before making health-related decisions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Individual Results May Vary:</strong> The Services may feature success stories, testimonials, or before-and-after examples from other users. These examples are not typical and do not guarantee that you will achieve similar results. Individual results depend on numerous factors including genetics, starting fitness level, adherence to programs, diet, lifestyle factors, and more. We make no guarantee that you will achieve any particular results from using the Services.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third-Party Content and User-Generated Content:</strong> The Services may contain content from third parties or other users, including but not limited to activity suggestions, challenge descriptions, motivational content, and social features. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the accuracy or safety of any third-party or user-generated content. You should independently verify any information and assess the safety of any activities before engaging in them.</p>
        
        <div class="important-notice">

        <p><strong>Federal Arbitration Act:</strong> You and Amicado agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of the arbitration provisions in these Terms will be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.</p>
        
        <h2>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
        
        <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
        
        <p>You and Amicado agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, formation, or applicability thereof (collectively, "Disputes"), will be settled by binding individual arbitration, except as otherwise provided in this section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us</li>
            <li>Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement</li>
            <li>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation</li>
            <li>Claims that may arise after termination of these Terms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
        
        <p>Before initiating arbitration, you must first send us a written notice of your Dispute ("Notice of Dispute") to legal@amicado.com or Amicado, Inc., Legal Department, 123 Wellness Way, San Francisco, CA 94105. The Notice of Dispute must:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute</li>
            <li>Set forth the specific relief sought</li>
            <li>Include your name, address, email, and phone number</li>
            <li>Be personally signed by you</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We will attempt to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you via email or phone. If we cannot resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days of receiving the Notice of Dispute, either party may proceed to arbitration.</p>
        
        <h3>Mediation</h3>
        
        <p>If informal dispute resolution fails, the parties agree to participate in mediation administered by JAMS under its Mediation Rules before proceeding to arbitration. The parties will share the mediator's fee equally. Mediation will take place in San Francisco, California, or by video conference if mutually agreed.</p>
        
        <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
        
        <p>If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiation or mediation, it will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as appropriate. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless you and Amicado agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees. Otherwise, Amicado will pay all JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.</p>
        
        <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator</li>
            <li>The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes, including arbitrability</li>
            <li>The arbitration will be confidential, and neither party may disclose the existence, content, or results of the arbitration, except as required by law</li>
            <li>The arbitrator may award any relief that would be available in court</li>
            <li>The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
        
        <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>YOU AND AMICADO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Unless both you and Amicado agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative, class, or collective proceeding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Mass Arbitration Procedures</h3>
        
        <p>If 25 or more similar arbitration demands are filed against Amicado relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact ("Mass Arbitration"), the parties agree to the following procedures:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bellwether Proceedings:</strong> The parties will select 10 arbitration demands to proceed first ("Bellwether Arbitrations"). Amicado will select 5 and claimants' counsel will select 5. The remaining demands will be stayed pending resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Global Mediation:</strong> After the Bellwether Arbitrations are resolved, the parties will participate in a global mediation to resolve the remaining demands, informed by the outcomes of the Bellwether Arbitrations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Continued Arbitrations:</strong> If global mediation does not resolve all remaining demands within 60 days, the parties will select another set of 10 demands to arbitrate, following the same selection process, and will continue this process until all demands are resolved.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fee Allocation:</strong> For Mass Arbitrations, Amicado will pay all JAMS fees for the Bellwether Arbitrations. For any subsequent arbitrations, fees will be allocated according to JAMS rules.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
        
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for Disputes within that court's jurisdiction. Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Time Limitation:</strong> Any arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after the Dispute arises. If arbitration is not commenced within this period, the claim is permanently barred.</p>
        
        <h3>Opt-Out Right</h3>
        
        <p>You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@amicado.com within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of the arbitration agreement. If you opt out, neither you nor Amicado will be required to arbitrate Disputes as described above.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable in whole or in part, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and Disputes will be resolved in court. If any other provision of this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> Claimants' counsel in Mass Arbitrations and JAMS are intended third-party beneficiaries of this arbitration provision and may enforce it according to its terms.</p>
        
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        
        <h3>Termination by Amicado</h3>

        <h3>Termination by You</h3>

        <h3>Effects of Termination</h3>
        
        <p>Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>
