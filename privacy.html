        <h3>Legal Requirements and Protection</h3>

        <h3>With Your Consent</h3>
        <p>We may share your information for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or with your explicit consent.</p>

        <p><strong>No Health Data Marketing:</strong> We absolutely never use any health-related information for advertising or marketing purposes. Since HealthKit data remains on your device, we don't even have access to it. Any wellness information you manually provide is used solely for service functionality, never for marketing.</p>
        
        <h2>IV. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h2>

        <h3>Do-Not-Track Signals</h3>
        <p>Some web browsers and devices allow you to broadcast a preference that your online activities not be tracked. At this time, our Services do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals, but we continue to evaluate potential responses to these signals as standards and practices evolve.</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Information Collected Through Cookies</h3>
        <p>The information collected through cookies and similar technologies may include personal information such as your IP address, device identifiers, and usage patterns.

To protect your privacy and security, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request by matching information you provide with information we have on file. In some jurisdictions, you may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. We may require proof that the agent has been authorized to act on your behalf.</p>
        
        <h3>In-App Data Management</h3>
        <p>Amicado provides built-in features to help you manage your data directly:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Download Your Data:</strong> Access your complete data export through Settings > Privacy > Download My Data. Your data package will be prepared and made available for download within 48 hours. For security reasons, you can request a data download once every 24 hours. The export includes all your activity data, profile information, challenge history, and other information associated with your account</li>
            
            <li><strong>Delete Your Account:</strong> Permanently delete your account and all associated data through Settings > Privacy > Delete Account. This action will immediately log you out and queue your data for permanent deletion.

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. We will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices, provide you a different level or quality of services, or otherwise treat you differently because you exercised your privacy rights. However, if you choose to delete certain information or restrict our processing, some features of the Services that require that information may no longer be available to you.</p>
        
        <h2>VI. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
        
        <p>Amicado operates globally and your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country in which you reside, including the United States where our primary servers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country. By using our Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to these countries.</p>
        
        <p>For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), we implement appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal information to countries outside the EEA and UK. These safeguards may include contractual obligations requiring recipients to protect your personal information to standards equivalent to those in your jurisdiction, and where applicable, Standard Contractual Clauses approved by regulatory authorities.</p>
        
        <h2>VII. CHILDREN</h2>
        
        <p>Amicado's Services are not directed to children under the age specified by applicable law (generally 13 or 16 years old depending on jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate parental consent where required by law. For minors whose accounts are properly created with parental consent, we implement special protections: all data processing for minors' accounts occurs strictly on-device, ensuring that no information about minors is transmitted to or stored on our servers. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child without proper consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>
        
        <h2>VIII. HEALTHKIT AND ON-DEVICE DATA PROCESSING</h2>
        
        <p>We integrate with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit to provide comprehensive activity tracking while maintaining the highest privacy standards. Here's how we handle this sensitive data:</p>
        
        <h3>HealthKit Data Protection</h3>
        <p><strong>100% On-Device Processing:</strong> All HealthKit and Google Fit data remains exclusively on your device. We never collect, transmit, store, or have access to this data on our servers. This includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Heart rate data and patterns</li>
            <li>Step counts and distance measurements</li>
